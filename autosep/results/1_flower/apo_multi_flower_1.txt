feedbacks: ["The prompt you provided is quite comprehensive, but it may still lead to incorrect descriptions due to several factors:\n\n1. **Generic Descriptions**: The prompt asks for a \"comprehensive detail,\" which can sometimes result in overly generic descriptions that don't capture the unique features of the object. For example, describing a flower as having \"smooth, glossy texture\" without specifying the type of texture (waxy, leathery, etc.) can make it difficult to distinguish between different species.\n\n2. **Overemphasis on General Features**: The prompt focuses on general features such as \"overall shape and body structure,\" \"specific colors and patterns,\" \"textures,\" and \"unique distinctive markings.\" While these are important, they can sometimes overshadow the specific details that are crucial for accurate identification. For instance, the description of the Anthurium flower in the first example mentions the \"slightly ruffled edge\" of the bract, which is a distinctive feature that helps in identifying the species.\n\n3. **Lack of Specificity in Texture**: The prompt asks for \"textures\" but doesn't specify what kind of texture is being described. For example, the description of the marigold in the second example mentions a \"slightly ruffled texture,\" which is not very specific. A more precise description would be \"smooth with a slight ruffled texture,\" which helps in distinguishing it from other flowers.\n\n4. **Ambiguity in Distinctive Markings**: The prompt asks for \"unique distinctive markings,\" but the descriptions sometimes include features that are common to many species. For example, the description of the marigold includes the \"gradient from the center to the tips of the petals,\" which is a common feature among many flowers and not a distinctive marking for marigolds.\n\n5. **Overgeneralization of Features**: The prompt doesn't provide enough constraints to ensure that the description is specific to the object in the image. For example, the description of the orchid in the fourth example includes features that are common to many orchids, such as \"smooth and glossy texture,\" which is not specific to the Paphiopedilum genus.\n\nTo improve the prompt, consider the following adjustments:\n\n1. **Specify the Object Type**: Clearly state whether the object is a flower, fruit, insect, etc., to avoid confusion.\n2. **Provide Specific Examples**: Include examples of how to describe specific features (e.g., \"waxy texture,\" \"leathery texture,\" \"smooth with a slight ruffled texture\").\n3. **Focus on Distinctive Features**: Emphasize the importance of distinctive features that set the object apart from others.\n4. **Avoid Overgeneralization**: Ensure that the description is specific to the object in the image and avoids common features that are not unique to the object.\n\nHere\u2019s an improved version of your prompt:\n\n---\n\n**Prompt:**\n\n\"Describe the main object in the given image in comprehensive detail.

feedbacks: ["The prompt provided is quite comprehensive, but it seems to lack specificity regarding certain key details that can help in distinguishing the object in the image from other similar objects. Here are some potential reasons why the prompt might have generated incorrect descriptions:\n\n1. **Lack of Specificity in Visual Features**: The prompt asks for a \"detailed description\" but does not provide enough specific criteria to differentiate between similar objects. For instance, the description of the petals' texture (smooth, velvety) is vague and could apply to many types of flowers. More specific terms would help narrow down the possibilities.\n\n2. **Overemphasis on General Characteristics**: The prompt focuses on general characteristics such as \"overall shape,\" \"colors and patterns,\" and \"textures.\" While these are important, they can be shared by many different types of flowers. For example, the \"cup-shaped form\" and \"ruffled edges\" are common among various flower species, making it hard to pinpoint the exact type.\n\n3. **Insufficient Distinctive Markings**: The prompt asks for \"unique distinctive markings,\" but the descriptions often fail to highlight specific features that are unique to the object in question. For example, the description of the \"gradient coloration from deep red to light white\" is a distinctive feature of the flower in the image, but it is not mentioned in the wrong descriptions.\n\n4. **Ambiguity in Background and Context**: The prompt instructs to ignore the background and surrounding context, but sometimes the context can provide clues about the type of object. For instance, if the image were taken in a garden with other similar flowers, it might help in narrowing down the possibilities.\n\n5. **Lack of Specific Terminology**: The descriptions often use general terms like \"smooth\" or \"velvety,\" which are not specific enough to distinguish between similar objects. More precise terms, such as \"glossy,\" \"velvety-smooth,\" or \"slightly ruffled,\" would be more helpful.\n\nTo improve the prompt, consider adding more specific criteria, such as:\n\n- **Precise Color Descriptions**: Use specific shades and gradients.\n- **Distinctive Features**: Mention unique shapes, patterns, or textures.\n- **Comparison to Known Objects**: Provide a comparison to known objects or species to help distinguish it from similar ones.\n\nHere\u2019s an improved version of the prompt:\n\n\"Describe the main object in the given image in comprehensive detail. Focus on distinctive visual features that help identify its specific category or species.\n\nPlease cover the following aspects if applicable:\n- **Overall Shape and Body Structure**: Describe the main form and structure of the object, including any unique shapes or patterns.\n- **Specific Colors and Patterns on Different Body Parts**: Provide detailed descriptions of the colors and patterns on various parts of the object, such as petals, leaves, or other structures.\n- **Textures**: Describe the surface texture, such as smooth, velvety, glossy, etc.\n- **Unique Distinctive Markings**: Identify any unique features or patterns that set this object apart from others.\n\nIgnore the background, lighting, and surrounding context.

feedbacks: ["The prompt provided is quite comprehensive and should theoretically capture the necessary details to accurately describe the object in the image. However, the issues with the generated descriptions suggest that the problem lies in the way the prompt is structured and how it handles the specific characteristics of the object. Here are some potential reasons why the prompt might have led to incorrect descriptions:\n\n1. **Lack of Specificity in the Prompt**: The prompt asks for a \"comprehensive detail,\" but it doesn't provide enough specificity regarding what constitutes a \"distinctive feature.\" This vagueness can lead to descriptions that are either too general or too specific, missing key details that are crucial for accurate identification.\n\n2. **Overemphasis on General Characteristics**: The prompt focuses on general characteristics like \"overall shape and body structure,\" \"specific colors and patterns,\" \"textures,\" and \"unique distinctive markings.\" While these are important, they might not always be sufficient to distinguish between closely related species. For instance, the description of the Desert Rose (Adenium obesum) and Cosmos bipinnatus both include similar characteristics, leading to confusion.\n\n3. **Insufficient Focus on Unique Features**: The prompt asks for \"unique distinctive markings,\" but it doesn't specify that these should be the most distinguishing features. In the case of the Desert Rose, the unique feature is the gradient coloration from red to white, which is not mentioned in the wrong description. Similarly, the wrong description for the cosmos flower focuses on the petal edges and the center disk, which are not the most distinctive features of the cosmos flower.\n\n4. **Misinterpretation of Visual Details**: The wrong descriptions sometimes misinterpret the visual details. For example, the wrong description for the Desert Rose mentions a \"cosmos flower\" and describes it as having a \"symmetrical, radial shape with multiple layers of petals radiating outward from a central core,\" which is not accurate for the Desert Rose. Similarly, the wrong description for the cosmos flower incorrectly describes the petals as \"a deep, rich purple with a slight gradient,\" which is not characteristic of the cosmos flower.\n\n5. **Lack of Contextual Clues**: The prompt ignores the background, lighting, and surrounding context, which can provide important clues for identification. For instance, the presence of a branch in the image of the Desert Rose might suggest that the object is indeed a flower, but this detail is not captured in the wrong descriptions.\n\nTo improve the prompt, it would be beneficial to include specific instructions on what constitutes a \"distinctive feature\" and to emphasize the importance of unique characteristics over general ones. Additionally, the prompt could benefit from including examples of what constitutes a \"correct\" versus \"incorrect\" description to guide the model better."]
feedbacks: ["The prompt you provided is quite comprehensive, but it may still lead to incorrect descriptions due to several factors:\n\n1. **Lack of Specificity in Features**: The prompt asks for \"distinctive visual features,\" but it doesn't specify what makes the object unique compared to others in the same category. For example, both the poppy and the cosmos flower share some common features like having multiple layers of petals and a central core, which can make it challenging to differentiate them based on the prompt alone.\n\n2. **Overemphasis on Common Features**: The prompt focuses on general characteristics like \"overall shape and body structure,\" \"specific colors and patterns,\" \"textures,\" and \"unique distinctive markings.\" While these are important, they can sometimes be shared among different species. For instance, the poppy and the cosmos flower both have a symmetrical, radial shape, which is a common feature in many flower species.\n\n3. **Ambiguity in Descriptions**: The descriptions provided for the wrong answers are often very similar to those for the correct answers. For example, both the correct and wrong descriptions for the poppy mention the white petals, the yellow center, and the smooth texture. This similarity can make it hard to distinguish between the two.\n\n4. **Insufficient Detail**: Sometimes, the descriptions are too generic or lack sufficient detail to accurately identify the object. For instance, the wrong description for the poppy mentions a \"cluster of flowers\" and \"plumeria,\" which are not accurate for the image provided. Similarly, the wrong description for the cosmos flower mentions a \"cosmos flower\" when the image clearly shows a different flower.\n\n5. **Contextual Clues Missing**: The prompt does not account for contextual clues that might help in identifying the object. For example, the presence of leaves, the environment, or the overall setting can provide additional information that helps in distinguishing the object. In the case of the poppy, the image shows a single flower with a clear focus on its petals and center, which is a strong indicator of the poppy species.\n\nTo improve the prompt, consider including more specific questions or criteria that can help narrow down the possibilities. For example:\n\n- \"What is the specific arrangement of the petals?\"\n- \"Are there any unique patterns or markings on the petals?\"\n- \"How do the colors vary across the petals?\"\n- \"Is there any particular texture or pattern on the stamens?\"\n\nBy incorporating these specific questions, the prompt would better guide the generation of detailed and accurate descriptions, reducing the likelihood of incorrect identifications."]

These could be color variations, spots, stripes, or other distinguishing features.\n\n### Example:\n- **Overall Shape and Body Structure**: The flower has a large, rounded shape with multiple layers of petals. Each petal is broad and slightly ruffled at the edges, giving it a full and lush appearance. The petals are arranged in a circular pattern around a central point, creating a symmetrical and elegant form.\n- **Specific Colors and Patterns**: The primary color of the petals is a vibrant red, which is most prominent towards the outer edges. As you move inward, the red gradually transitions into a lighter shade, almost white, near the center of each petal. This creates a beautiful gradient effect, enhancing the flower's visual appeal. There are no distinct patterns other than the natural variation in color intensity across the petals.\n- **Textures**: The surface of the petals appears to have a smooth texture, with subtle variations in the ruffled edges adding a delicate, almost velvety feel. The transition from red to white is smooth, without any visible scales or fur-like textures.\n- **Unique Distinctive Markings**: The most distinctive marking is the gradient coloration from deep red to light white. This gradient is consistent across all the petals, contributing to the flower's overall beauty and making it easily identifiable as an Adenium obesum.\n\n### Ignore the Background, Lighting, and Surrounding Context.
