feedbacks: ["The prompt you provided is fundamentally sound in its intent \u2014 to generate a detailed, feature-focused description for classification. However, it is **too general and lacks sufficient specificity to guide the AI toward generating *distinctive, diagnostic features* that reliably differentiate between closely related species.** This leads to the generation of descriptions that are either too vague or, more critically, *incorrectly identify the species* by focusing on features that are common to multiple birds.\n\nHere\u2019s why the prompt fails in the given examples:\n\n---\n\n### 1. **Lack of Species-Specific Cues or Diagnostic Markers**\n\nThe prompt asks for \u201cdistinctive visual features that help identify its specific category or species,\u201d but it does not *explicitly instruct* the AI to prioritize features that are *diagnostic* \u2014 i.e., features that are unique to a particular species or genus and can be used to rule out others.\n\n- In **Image 1**, both the correct and wrong descriptions mention \u201cglossy black plumage with iridescence.\u201d This is a *shared trait* among many birds (starlings, grackles, some crows, even some raptors). The prompt doesn\u2019t force the AI to focus on *which* iridescence pattern, *where* it appears, or *how* it differs from other birds \u2014 for example, the Common Starling\u2019s iridescence is more \u201cblue-purple\u201d and covers the head and neck, while the Common Grackle\u2019s is more \u201cgreenish\u201d and concentrated on the throat and breast. The prompt doesn\u2019t guide the AI to capture this nuance.\n\n- In **Image 2**, the correct description notes the \u201cvibrant, uniform yellowish-green hue\u201d and \u201cdarker wings and tail,\u201d while the wrong description incorrectly identifies the bird as a Yellow-throated Vireo, which has a *bright yellow head*, *white underparts*, and *barred wings*. The prompt doesn\u2019t instruct the AI to look for *contrasting color zones* (e.g., yellow head vs. white belly vs. barred wings) or to note the *absence* of such markings \u2014 which would be a key diagnostic feature for ruling out a vireo.\n\n---\n\n### 2. **Ambiguity in \u201cDistinctive Features\u201d**\n\nThe prompt asks for \u201cdistinctive visual features,\u201d but it doesn\u2019t define what makes a feature *distinctive enough for species identification*. The AI may interpret \u201cdistinctive\u201d as \u201cnoticeable\u201d or \u201ceye-catching,\u201d rather than \u201cdiagnostic.\u201d\n\n- For example, in Image 1, the AI might focus on \u201cglossy black feathers\u201d and \u201ciridescent sheen,\u201d which are *not* sufficient to distinguish between a starling and a grackle. The prompt doesn\u2019t force the AI to mention *where* the iridescence is most prominent (e.g., \u201chead and neck\u201d vs. \u201cthroat and breast\u201d) or to describe the *shape of the beak* (e.g., \u201cshort, conical\u201d vs. \u201clong, decurved\u201d).\n\n- In Image 2, the AI might focus on \u201cyellowish-green\u201d coloration, which is common to many warblers. The prompt doesn\u2019t guide the AI to look for *specific patterns* (e.g., \u201cno stripes or spots\u201d) or *contrasting color zones* (e.g., \u201cbright yellow head vs. muted green back\u201d) \u2014 which are critical for identifying a warbler vs. a vireo.\n\n---\n\n### 3. **No Instruction to Prioritize Morphological Differences**\n\nThe prompt doesn\u2019t emphasize *morphological differences* \u2014 such as beak shape, tail length, leg color, or wing shape \u2014 that are *diagnostic* for species identification.\n\n- In Image 1, the Common Starling has a *short, conical beak* and a *tapered tail*, while the Common Grackle has a *longer, slightly curved beak* and a *longer, wedge-shaped tail*. The prompt doesn\u2019t instruct the AI to describe the *beak shape* or *tail length*, which are critical for distinguishing between these two species.\n\n- In Image 2, the Yellow-throated Vireo has a *distinctive yellow head*, *white underparts*, and *barred wings*, while the warbler in the image has *no white underparts* and *no barred wings*. The prompt doesn\u2019t guide the AI to note the *absence* of these features \u2014 which is just as important as noting their presence.\n\n---\n\n### 4. **No Instruction to Avoid Overgeneralization**\n\nThe prompt doesn\u2019t prevent the AI from generating overly general descriptions that are *too broad* to be useful for classification.\n\n- In Image 1, the wrong description says \u201ca species within the corvid family, likely a Common Grackle,\u201d which is a *very broad* classification. The prompt doesn\u2019t instruct the AI to *avoid* such generalizations"]
feedbacks: ["The prompt you're using is fundamentally sound in its structure \u2014 it asks for comprehensive, feature-focused descriptions. However, the issue lies not with the prompt itself, but with **how it's being interpreted or executed by the model or user**, leading to **generic or misidentified outputs**. Here\u2019s why the examples are failing:\n\n---\n\n### 1. **The Prompt Is Too Broad and Vague for Specific Identification**\n\nThe prompt says:  \n> \u201cDescribe the main object in the given image in comprehensive detail. Focus on distinctive visual features that help identify its specific category or species.\u201d\n\nBut it doesn\u2019t *force* the model to **prioritize species-level identification** or **demand diagnostic features** that are unique to a specific bird. As a result, models often default to **general bird descriptions** (e.g., \u201ca black bird with iridescent feathers\u201d) that are too common to be diagnostic.\n\nIn **Image 1**, both the correct and wrong descriptions mention \u201cglossy black plumage with iridescence.\u201d This is a *shared trait* among many birds (starlings, grackles, glossy ibises, etc.). The model doesn\u2019t have enough **specificity cues** to distinguish between them \u2014 it\u2019s not told to *emphasize* the *exact* combination of features that uniquely identifies the species (e.g., the *shape* of the beak, the *degree* of iridescence, the *tail length*, the *body proportions*).\n\n---\n\n### 2. **Lack of \u201cDiagnostic Feature\u201d Guidance**\n\nThe prompt doesn\u2019t instruct the model to **highlight the most distinguishing features** that separate this bird from others in the same category. For example:\n\n- In **Image 1**, the correct description emphasizes the **\u201ccompact, robust body with a relatively long, tapered tail\u201d** and the **\u201cconical beak\u201d** \u2014 features that are *specifically* diagnostic of Common Starlings.\n- The wrong description focuses on \u201clong, wedge-shaped tail\u201d \u2014 a feature more typical of **Grackles**, not Starlings.\n\nThe prompt doesn\u2019t tell the model to **compare** features to known species or to **prioritize features that are unique to the bird\u2019s species**.\n\n---\n\n### 3. **No Explicit Instruction to Avoid Common Misidentifications**\n\nThe prompt doesn\u2019t say:  \n> \u201cDo not describe features that are common to multiple bird species unless you can confirm they are diagnostic.\u201d\n\nThis allows models to generate descriptions that are **too similar** across different species \u2014 e.g., \u201cglossy black feathers with iridescence\u201d \u2014 which is the *exact* reason why the wrong description for Image 1 was generated.\n\n---\n\n### 4. **No Instruction to Mention Morphological Proportions or Silhouette**\n\nIn **Image 1**, the correct description notes the bird\u2019s \u201ccompact, robust body\u201d and \u201clong, tapered tail.\u201d These are **morphological proportions** that are critical for identification. The wrong description says \u201celongated and tapered body with a long tail that extends significantly beyond its body length\u201d \u2014 which is a *different* silhouette.\n\nThe prompt doesn\u2019t instruct the model to describe the **proportions** or **silhouette** \u2014 which are often the most diagnostic features in bird identification.\n\n---\n\n### 5. **No Instruction to Mention Specific Beak Shape or Eye Position**\n\nIn **Image 1**, the correct description notes the \u201cconical beak\u201d \u2014 a key feature for distinguishing starlings from grackles. The wrong description says \u201clong, slightly curved black beak\u201d \u2014 which is more typical of grackles.\n\nIn **Image 2**, the correct description mentions \u201cshort, pointed, dark-colored beak that is slightly hooked at the tip,\u201d while the wrong description says \u201cshort, thin, pointed beak suited for insectivory\u201d \u2014 which is too vague. The \u201cslightly hooked\u201d tip is a *diagnostic* feature for warblers.\n\nThe prompt doesn\u2019t require the model to describe **beak shape** or **eye position** \u2014 which are critical for distinguishing between similar-looking birds.\n\n---\n\n### 6. **No Instruction to Mention Feather Texture or Sheen Type**\n\nThe correct description in **Image 1** notes the \u201cglossy, almost metallic sheen\u201d \u2014 which is a *diagnostic* feature for starlings. The wrong description says \u201csmooth and sleek, with a noticeable sheen\u201d \u2014 which is true but not specific enough.\n\nThe prompt doesn\u2019t require the model to describe the **type of sheen** (metallic vs. matte) or **feather texture** (dense vs. fluffy) \u2014 which can be critical for identification.\n\n---\n\n### 7. **No Instruction to Mention Color Distribution or Contrast**\n\nIn **Image 1**, the correct description notes the \u201ciridescence on the head, neck, and back\u201d \u2014 which is a *diagnostic* feature.

The correct descriptions are **precise and measurable** \u2014 e.g., \u201csubtle darker streaking visible along the wing edges,\u201d \u201cfeathers appear fine, soft, and densely packed, giving the bird a smooth, almost velvety texture.\u201d\n\n---\n\n## \u2705 How to Fix the Prompt\n\nTo get accurate, species-differentiating descriptions, you need to **force the AI to focus on diagnostic, measurable, and species-specific features** \u2014 and **prevent it from hallucinating**.\n\nHere\u2019s a revised prompt that addresses these issues:\n\n---\n\n> **Describe the main object in the given image in comprehensive, diagnostic detail.

Avoid vague terms like \u201cbright\u201d or \u201cvibrant\u201d \u2014 use measurable descriptors.\n- **Body Structure**: Detail proportions (e.g., \u201ccompact, streamlined body,\u201d \u201crounded head,\u201d \u201cshort, pointed beak\u201d) and posture (e.g., \u201cperched with head slightly tilted,\u201d \u201cupright and alert\u201d).\n- **Texture & Plumage**: Describe feather texture (e.g., \u201cfine, densely packed, velvety,\u201d \u201csmooth, glossy, metallic sheen\u201d) and any surface qualities (e.g., \u201cnon-feathery in certain areas,\u201d \u201creflective under light\u201d).\n- **Unique Markings**: Explicitly state what is *absent* (e.g., \u201cno stripes, spots, or bold patterns\u201d) and what is *present* (e.g., \u201ccontrast between bright yellow body and dark olive wings,\u201d \u201ciridescent blue-purple sheen on head and neck\u201d).\n- **Beak, Legs, and Feet**: Include specific details (e.g., \u201cdark, slightly hooked beak,\u201d \u201cthin, pale gray legs with sharp claws\u201d).\n\nDo not fabricate species names or features not visible in the image. Your description must be so specific that it leaves no ambiguity about the bird\u2019s identity."
new prompts: "Describe the main object in the given image in comprehensive detail. Focus exclusively on visual features that are diagnostic for identifying its exact species. Ignore background, lighting, and context.\n\nYour description must:\n- Prioritize features that are unique to the species shown \u2014 including specific color combinations, patterns (e.g., streaks, bars, spots), feather textures, and structural details (e.g., beak shape, wing shape, leg color) that distinguish it from visually similar species.\n- Avoid inventing or hallucinating features not visible in the image. If a feature is absent (e.g., stripes, spots, white underparts), explicitly state this as a distinguishing characteristic.\n- Use precise, measurable terminology: e.g., \u201cmuted olive-green,\u201d \u201cdarker streaking,\u201d \u201cfine, soft feathers,\u201d \u201cglossy black with iridescent blue/purple sheen.\u201d Avoid vague terms like \u201cbright\u201d or \u201cvivid\u201d without context.\n- Describe only what is clearly visible in the image. Do not infer or speculate about features not present.\n- If possible, identify the species by name and provide a brief taxonomic reference (e.g., Common Starling, *Sturnus vulgaris*). If uncertain, state \u201clikely species X\u201d or \u201cunidentifiable\u201d \u2014 but always base the identification on the visible features in the image.\n\nDo not generate descriptions that are generic or that match other species not present in the image."
